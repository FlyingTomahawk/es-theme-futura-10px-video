# Futura 10px video
Theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie


About
-----

The theme layout is based on the Newgen theme by Ruckage.


License
-------

The frames and background were made by me and can be replicated, modified or used under the CC-BY-NC-SA license.
I used 2 fonts for this theme and one of it (Audiowide) needs the OFL.txt file to be included if used. 
You can of course use any other font if you wish, just make sure you got the license for it if needed.

Notes
-----

- This theme was build on a 1080p (1920x1080) resolution and is best used on a 16:9 Full HD TV. 
- This theme might not look good on smaller screens or 4:3 aspect ratio monitors/TVs.
- I just used random screenshots for the system view. You can replace them if you like by using the PSD files inside the "_screenshot layouts" folder.
- I created themes for 40+ systems and hopefully I will be able to add some few more if time allows.
- Special thanks to Matt Kennedy for his help and guidance.
